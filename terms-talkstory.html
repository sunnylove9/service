Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do not control, endorse or take responsibility for any third-party content available on or linked to by our Services, including Content posted by our users.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Services are Available "AS-IS"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE TalkStory ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</span></p>

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the TalkStory Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1). Links</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the TalkStory Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources.

You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2). Limitation of Liability</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TalkStory ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE TalkStory ENTITIES EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TalkStory, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TalkStory ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>11. Arbitration Provision/Class-Action Waiver</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with TalkStory and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Except for any dispute arising out of or related to a violation of Section 7 or the TalkStory Rules, or disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court, if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and TalkStory waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in San Mateo County, California before and in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You and TalkStory agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and TalkStory and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You and TalkStory agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 11will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and TalkStory agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Company will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by TalkStory, TalkStory will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and TalkStory agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Mateo County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any claim you may have arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred, which means that you and TalkStory will not have the right to assert the claim.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>12. Waiver and Severability</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The failure of TalkStory to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>13. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Mateo County, California, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>14. Entire Agreement</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These Terms, including the TalkStory Rules for the TalkStory Services, our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between TalkStory and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with TalkStory that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between TalkStory and you regarding the Services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at TalkStory.co/terms. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you the next time you sign in to our mobile application. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>15. Ending these Terms</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or TalkStory as follows.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may end your legal agreement with TalkStory at any time for any or no reason by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. You do not need to specifically inform TalkStory when you stop using the Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your accounts, your accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the TalkStory Rules, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you the next time you attempt to access your account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nothing in this section shall affect TalkStory’s rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us in the app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
